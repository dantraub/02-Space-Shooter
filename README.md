# Project 02 Space Shooter

The best space shooter on the planet that looks up to the night sky and sees my game being played, but in real life. Made on the coolest day to make games related to space, May the 4th, 2022.

## Future Development
Ok so there is a lot of stuff I still want to get done on this as going through everything this was my favorite project.
1. Increasing (infinite) levels 
2. With that enemies that increasingly spawn in
3. More consistent power-ups spawning
4. Better models
5. Different types of enemies
As you play the game I'm sure you can tell there was an effort to make the level and enemy system work, but after 3 hours of looking up different documentation and me forgetting what your answer was when I asked you I was unabel to spawn more enemies therefore leading the level counter to stack uninterrupted.
